<h2> Where it began ... back to my roots ... </h2>

<p> 
    Growing up inspired and motivated under a hispanic culture has always had its advantages and disadvantages.
    For starters, at a young age I was determined to become someone that no one in my family thought could ever be achievable.
    I never had a path to follow, nor a path to look up too, rather a path to build upon and leave for my proceeding generations to continue on.
